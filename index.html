            <!-- <h3>WELCOME HERE!</h3> -->
            <p>
                I am a second-year Biomedical Engineering master's student at Carnegie Mellon University advised by <a href = "https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~tai/"> Tai-Sing Lee </a> in the Center for Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC) and Department of Computer Science. 
                I am particularly interested in unraveling the governing principles behind neural dynamics and complex neural systems using quantitative methods and computational models.
                Aside from that, I also have a strong affinity for physics and mathematics. My ultimate goal is to harmonize these diverse disciplines to address challenges of dynamic neural complex system. 
                Currently, I am actively seeking a computational neuroscience/neuroengineering PhD position for 2024 fall.

            <p><b>Current Work</b></p>
            <p>
                I currently works on exploring the neural circuit plasticity in the early visual cortex as a result of familiarity learning with video stimulus. This research seeks to answer whether neural connectivity in the early visual cortex can encode spatial temporal memories with horizontal connections, leading to familiarity suppression.
                I am also investigating the familiarity effect in neural networks by examining how the neural responses in a hierarchical neural network compare to physiological data when exposed to familiar stimuli. 
                In addition, I also used dimensionality reduction methods on neural data to explore the evolution of neural trajectories in lower-dimensional manifolds in a monkey observing familiar data.

            <!-- <h3>MORE BACKGROUND...</h3> -->
            <p><b>More Background</b></p>

            <p>
                I worked on various projects in Physics and Engineering before I joining CMU, including theoretical and experimental works.    
            </p>
            <!-- <p>Theoretical</p> -->
            <p>
                Theoretical: I received an undergraduate scholarship from <a href = "https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/index.php"> Academia Sinica, Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics</a>, and advised by <a href = "https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv.php?i=hirashita"> Hiroyuki Hirashita </a> in developing a computational model to reveal the obervational bias of galaxies' properties with ALMA observatory. 

            </p>
            <!-- <p>Experimental</p> -->
            <p>
                Experimental: I worked on data collection and analysis for photodetectors, which are used for eliminating heat noise in graviational wave detectors, 
                under the guidance of <a href = "https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/directory_en.php?directory=11&id_key=34"> Henry Tsz-King Wong</a> and <a href = "https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/directory_en.php?directory=11&id_key=162"> Yuki Inoue</a> at <a href="https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/index_en.php"> Academia Sinica, Institute of Physics</a>. 
                This work applied on ASGRAF, a new gravitational wave detector which can filled the detection frequency gap between existed devices. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan. My undergraduate project is building microdevices for liquid extraction, advised by <a href = "http://www.me.ntu.edu.tw/main.php?site_id=1"> Ya-Yu Chiang</a>.
