            <h3>WELCOME HERE!</h3>
            <p>
                I am a second-year Biomedical Engineering master student at Carnegie Mellon University advised by <a href = "https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~tai/"> Prof. Tai-Sing Lee </a> in the computer science department and CNBC (Center for Neural Basis of Cognition). 
                I am passionate about uncovering the fundamental principle/mechanism behind complex systems, particularly in neuroscience. <b>My interests lie in exploring the theoretical and computational principles of neural dynamics and population neural coding.</b> 
                Aside from that, I also have a strong affinity for physics and mathematics. My ultimate goal is to harmonize these diverse disciplines to address challenges of neural complex systems. 
                <b>Currently, I am actively seeking a computational neuroscience PhD position for 2024 fall.</b> 
            </p>

            <h3>CURRENTLY WORK ON...</h3>
            <p>
                I currently works on <b>Exploring the neural circuit plasticity in the early visual cortex as a result of familiarity learning with video stimulus by analyzing neural data and building computational models.</b> This research seeks to answer whether neural connectivity in the early visual cortex can encode spatial temporal memories with horizontal connections, leading to familiarity suppression.

            <h3>MORE BACKGROUND...</h3>
            <p>
                I have a genuine passion for physics, and I've enjoyed working on a variety of related projects before I joining CMU, including experimental and theoretical sides.    
            </p>
            <p><b>Theoretical:</b></p>
            <p>
                I received an undergraduate scholarship from <a href = "https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/index.php"> Academia Sinica, Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics</a>, and had the priviledge of being advised by <a href = "https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv.php?i=hirashita"> Prof. Hiroyuki Hirashita </a> in developing a computational model to reveal the properties of high-redshift galaxy dust. 

            </p>
            <p><b>Experimental:</b></p>
            <p>
                I worked on cryogenic systems and active vibration isolation systems for gravitational wave detection in LIGO (The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) group, under the guidance of <a href = "https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/directory_en.php?directory=11&id_key=34"> Prof. Henry Tsz-King Wong</a> and <a href = "https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/directory_en.php?directory=11&id_key=162"> Prof. Yuki Inoue</a> at <a href="https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/index_en.php"> Academia Sinica, Institute of Physics</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan. My undergraduate project is building microdevices for liquid-liquid extractor, advised by <a href = "http://www.me.ntu.edu.tw/main.php?site_id=1"> Prof. Ya-Yu Chiang</a>.
